So for everyone who has previously known as Profectus and the Innovation Hub @ St Cat's we have now rebranded as Bloom and the St Cats BloomLab. We had a variety of reasons for the rebrand, but we hope you like it.

We will be blogging in the future about a variety of topics to get any entrepreneur off of the ground. These will range from programming and tech basics, to simple business law and accounting. We will also have some interviews with entrepreneurs that come through the lab.

We hope you enjoy the future content to come to the site! If you want to give us some feedback on the new rebrand or site, feel free to contact us at feedback@bloom.org.au.
